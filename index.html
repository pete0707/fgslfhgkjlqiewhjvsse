          <p>- To interact with the chatbot, please simply click on the buttons showing up on the chatbot interface.</p>
          <p>- Please note that <b>the chatbot does not expect any response except button clicking when telling the story.</b> Please simply follow the story and wait for the buttons to show up.</p>
          <p>- If you have questions about the story, please simply click the button "I have a question". Otherwise, the chatbot expects you to click the "continue" button, which will then trigger a question for attention check and the story will continue afterwards.</p>
          <p>- Please <b>send your messages only when you clicked the button "I have a question" and prompted by the chatbot to share your thoughts</b>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>These will help ensure a smoother conversation and improve the quality of the interaction.<br><br>Thank you!</p>
